AnderCraft – Version 2.5.1: Pharack Edition
Version 2.5.1, titled Pharack Edition, is a major content update that expands gameplay while introducing a refreshed presentation.
This update adds eight new blocks, including signs, doors, obsidian, lava, fire, and an igniter used to start flames, along with additional new elements that enhance building and interaction. The menu theme has been updated, featuring a new visual style and background music to give AnderCraft a refreshed identity.

World Compatibility Limitations: Worlds created in newer versions cannot be imported into older releases. Attempting to load a world from a version newer than 2.5.1 (such as 2.5.2) will result in an error. Compatibility: Older worlds remain supported. Worlds from versions as early as 1.5 can be imported into 2.5.1, though minor corruption may occur due to format differences.

Patch Note 1 – World Access Requirement
Players are now required to create a world before accessing gameplay. In versions 2.0 and earlier, a critical bug allowed users to enter worlds without having created one, which led to major security vulnerabilities. This issue has been fully resolved in the current version to improve stability and protect world data.
